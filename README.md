# 🧑‍💻 SwiftUI Learning Project - Emoji Enum

This repository contains a SwiftUI project where I am experimenting with using enums and emojis to build components. The project is part of my journey to get more comfortable with SwiftUI.

## 🚀 Project Overview

As part of my SwiftUI learning process, I am exploring enums with emojis and their integration within a SwiftUI app. This project is focused on:

- Learning the basics of enums in Swift.
- Building simple UI components with SwiftUI.
- Using emojis to represent different cases in an enum.

## 📱 Features

- A list displaying emojis as raw values from an enum.
- Simple layout with SwiftUI’s declarative syntax.
- Use of `CaseIterable` to iterate through all enum cases.

## 🛠️ How to Run

- Open the project in Xcode.
- Build and run the project on the iOS simulator or device.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

- Understand how enums work in Swift.
- Get familiar with SwiftUI layouts and views.
- Use `CaseIterable` to iterate through all enum values and display them in the UI.
- Experiment with emoji-based enums and their display in a list view.
